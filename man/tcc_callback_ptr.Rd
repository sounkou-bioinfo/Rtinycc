\title{Get the C-compatible function pointer}
\usage{
tcc_callback_ptr(callback)
}
\arguments{
\item{callback}{A tcc_callback object}
}
\value{
An external pointer (address of the callback token)
}
\description{
Returns an external pointer that can be passed to compiled C code
as a function pointer. This is the opaque pointer used by trampolines.
The pointer handle keeps the underlying token alive until it is garbage
collected, even if the original callback is closed.
}
\details{
Pointer arguments and return values are treated as external pointers.
Use \\code{tcc_read_bytes()} or \\code{tcc_read_*()} helpers to inspect
pointed data when needed.
