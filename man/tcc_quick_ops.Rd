\title{Supported operations table for tcc_quick}
\usage{
tcc_quick_ops()
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns \code{category}, \code{r}, \code{c}, \code{vectorized}.
}
\description{
Returns a data.frame listing every R construct that \code{tcc_quick()} can
lower to C.  The table is assembled programmatically from the call
registry and from the lowerer/codegen, so it stays in sync with
the implementation.  The \code{vectorized} column indicates whether the
operation is fused element-wise into vector loops via condensation
(no intermediate allocation).
