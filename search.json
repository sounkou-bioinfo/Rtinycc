R side, make_callable() creates closure passes external pointer .Call (aliased .RtinyccCall keep R CMD check happy). design follows CFFI’s API-mode pattern: instead computing struct layouts calling conventions R (ABI-mode, like Python’s ctypes), generated C code lets TCC handle sizeof, offsetof, argument passing.
